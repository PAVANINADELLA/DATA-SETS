Does not effect function or fit and the grips are tight.  The groves in the bore originally appeared dark and the lands were crisp and shiny.  I disassembled the firearm and performed several cycles of Boretech C4 Carbon Remover and Boretech CU+2 Copper Remover.  Groves are now looking much better that carbon and copper buildup was scrubbed out.  Safety works as designed and the magazine drops free.  Comes with what appears to be an original leather holster that fits the firearm well.  Stitching on the holster is in very good condition.  This was my deceased uncles firearm which I have very little background on.  He occasionaly practiced with the firearm during deer hunting camp, other than that it spent most of its time in his nightstand drawer.Pistol comes with holster and one magazine and 2 boxes of older Remington ammunition with what appear to be solid copper round nose bullets.This would make a very good specimen for a collector or it would make a great little concealed carry pistol if you were so inclined.Not interested in trades.  Firearm sold as is without an expressed or implied warranty.  I will meet interested parties in the Cabelas parking lot in Richfield WI during business hours.  To purchase, you will need to show me your drivers license and preferably a current concealed carry permit, your C&R license or your FFL.  Cash only.  I will consider shipping at your expense to your FFL or C&R license holder.  Payment up front via USPS money order.Additional pictures provided upon request.Please, no lowball offers.  If you can find a Savage Model 1917 32ACP in this condition for less money, buy it."
